# ChatApp Frontend

This is the frontend for a simple chat web application, built with React and TypeScript. It uses React Router for client-side routing, Redux for state management, and shadcn/ui for a modern and responsive UI design.

The app connects to the backend over WebSocket using SockJS and STOMP.js, enabling real-time messaging between users. It provides an intuitive chat interface, handles user authentication with JWT tokens, and integrates seamlessly with the backend for sending and receiving messages.
